# 3d baby model

This is a project I did when I took CS 2334: programming structures and abstractions. The purpose of this project was to take data gathered from babies learning to crawl and creating a 3-d model from it. It was a project I worked on with a partner. The code can all be found in the src folder, and the csv files with all the data can be found in the origdata folder. 

## Recommended code samples
- GeneralValue.java: Class which defines a value read from the csv file (see also: GeneralValueTest.java)
- MultipleItemAbstract.java: Class which defines the statistical methods
- InfrantFrame.java: The GUI for this project. A lot of this code was provided to us by the professor, but I wrote most of the DataPanel portion of it.


Here's some important skills I learned from this project:

## Data analysis
In this project I generate statistics from the data given in the excel sheets about an infant's movements, and use those statistics to generate a model. I had to learn how to read data from an excel sheet, turn that data into an object, and then perform calculations, making sure the data was valid. 

## Proper code commenting
CS 2334 taught me the importance of clear and concise comments to simplify debugging and to make it easier to explain my code to someone else. I also gained experience generating javadocs.

## Testing
In this project I tested my code using JUnit tests. I had to make sure that I tested all edge cases properly to ensure 100% coverage of my code.

## Collaborating with others
Perhaps the most important lesson I learned from this lesson was how difficult it can be to work with another person on a programming project. I found it was critical to communicate with my partner every time I changed something in my code to make sure that what he was working on wouldn't cause any conflicts. Clear and frequent communication was the key to the success of this project.
